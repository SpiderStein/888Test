*   In order to run the project, execute in the terminal the following:
-   cd <this repo folder path >
-   "sudo docker-compose up --no-recreate --no-build"

*   I can polish the docker and compose files. Intentionally I wrote them in a so so quality, just wanted to simplify the way to run the project.
